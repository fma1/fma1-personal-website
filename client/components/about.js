    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am someone who has been coding from a young age as my father had introduced it me. To me, coding was just like legos. I just had fun building stuff. In college, I majored in Computer Science. And through my learning experiences in college, I learned to become emphathetic towards others and wanted to help others. I then attended Fullstack Academy to get more experience, and I learned about Full Stack Web Development. With how ubiquitous software is today, I believe in the power of software and I want to make a positive impact on society using my skills.</p>
